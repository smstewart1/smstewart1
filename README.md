- 👋 Hi, I’m @smstewart1
- 👀 I’m interested in learnign Python, SQL, and JS in order to build programs for data analysis and scheduling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3, and looking to learn other learn other languages such as SQL and JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scheduling programs.  Since I work with community colleges, I want to develop a scheduling software where managers enter in course information and faculty enter in their preferences; using a weighting system, the program sorts through all possible faculty/course combinations and outputs the most favorable schedules.
- 📫 Email is the best way to reach me, but due to the volatility of my schedule it may take some time to get back to you.
